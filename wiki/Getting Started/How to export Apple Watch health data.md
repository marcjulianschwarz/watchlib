1.  Open *Health* app
2.  Open your profile in the upper right corner
3.  Scroll down
4.  Tap on "Export all health data"
5.  Confirm that you want to export all health data
6.  Wait until the export has finished (this might take some minutes)
7.  Select "Save in files"
8.  Choose a folder and tap "Save"
9.  Last step is to unzip the "Export.zip" file

If you have followed the 9 steps listed above you should see a `apple_health_export` folder. In this folder you will find all of the data (workout routes, ECGs and other health data). You will have to use the path to this folder for the [[DataLoader]] and [[CacheHandler]].
